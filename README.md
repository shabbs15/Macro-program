_Run the program and open all you need with one keystroke_

#### Installation instructions

1. Download this repo as a zip file
2. Extract zip file

#### SetUp instructions

1. Click edit on the right-hand side to manipulate or delete a macro
2. Type into the textbox to create a new macro
3. Click the character left of the macro name to run the macro
  
#### Aditional Info

1. The program, left in it's default state would create an error, so be sure to change macro.json to include your programs and websites
2. Set the path of chrome in macro.json to allow you to open websites

Finally, I reccomend that you pin this program to the first position in your taskbar, using this tutorial: https://winaero.com/pin-file-taskbar-windows-10/, such that you can press win+1 to open it instantly
